    PBSM --- Proxy-Based Shared Memory
   ====================================

====================
1. INTRODUCTION
====================

PBSM (Proxy-Based Shared Memory) is a distributed programming technique
which consists in detecting read/write operations on data through a Proxy
and handling data coherency through a hidden run-time library.

This repository contains a C++ library to implement PBSM through templates
and function overloading.

Work-in-progress.


====================
2. BUILD STEPS
====================

Run the following commands:

	make
	make install

The executables are available in the bin/ directory

====================
3. SETUP
====================

The file /etc/pbsm/hosts.conf must contain the list of IP addresses of all nodes.
This file must be the same on all machines.

====================
4. APPLICATION CODE
====================

4.1 INCLUDES AND MAIN FUNCTION

The application code must include the file "pbsm.hpp":
	
	#include "pbsm.hpp"

Moreover, the main() function must call

		pbsm_init(argc, argv);

at the beginning to initialize the run-time.

See the example in the apps/ directory.


4.2 VARIABLES

Variables shared across nodes can be defined as follows:

       shared<int> a (PBSM);
       a = 5;
       a++;
       int b = a;
       func(a);

Shared variables can also be of user-defined types:

       class myclass {
       public:
       	void mymethod();
       	//...
       };

       shared <myclass> a (PBSM);
       a.mymethod();

It is also possible to define arrays of any data type:

       shared<std::array<int, 100>> better_array (PBSM);


4.3 FUNCTION CALLS

Functions can accept pointers and references to shared variables as arguments:

       void func(shared<int>& par)
       {
       	// ...
       }


4.4 NODE IDENTIFICATION

pbsm_tid is a variable containing the node id (0 is the master thread).

pbsm_hosts is a variable containing the total number of nodes.


4.5 BARRIERS

The macro PBSM_BARRIER() creates a barrier among all nodes in the code.


====================
5. RUNNING
====================

The application must be linked to the pthread and pbsm libraries (see the file
apps/Makefile for an example).

When running the application, the first parameter must specify the entry of the
machine in the /etc/pbsm/hosts.conf.
